# Project Description
This project explores the effect of salicylic acid application on gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, identifying which genes show greatest the change in expression between control and treatment groups, and using machine learning to predict if a gene will be upregulated or downregulated based on its expression under control conditions.
This project uses a dataset of gene expression profiles under treatment (leaf tissue of 3/4-week old plant, sprayed with 1 mM salicylic acid and 0.01% Silwet 2 hours before harvest) and control (leaf tissue of 3-4 week old plants, treated with only 0.01% Silwet 2 hours before harvest) conditions. 

# Code and Resources Used
This project was developed using Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.12.7.
Packages: pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy.

# Data 
The data for this comes from Thibaud-Nissen et al., Development of Arabidopsis whole-genome microarrays and their application to the discovery of binding sites for the TGA2 transcription factor in salicylic acid-treated plants. Plant J 2006 Jul;47(1):152-62.
Data was downloaded from GEO , accession number GDS2207, Dataset SOFT file (https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.abc.cardiff.ac.uk/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS2207).
